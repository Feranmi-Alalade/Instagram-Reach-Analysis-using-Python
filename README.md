# Instagram-Reach-Analysis-using-Python
Instagram is an American photo and video sharing social networking service founded in 2010 by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, 
and later acquired by American company Facebook Inc., now known as Meta Platforms. 
The app allows users to upload media that can be edited with filters and organized by hashtags and geographical tagging. 
Posts can be shared publicly or with preapproved followers. 
Users can browse other users' content by tag and location, view trending content, like photos, 
and follow other users to add their content to a personal feed.
Several business owners use Instagram to promote their business, and can see how well their posts are doing using the Insights section.
This project is to help content creators and business owners make good use of the data collected from Instagram and how to improve the reach of their posts.
# Data Collection
I have been researching Instagam over a couple of months, the data used in this project was collected manually from three handmade footwear stores in Nigeria,
namely Kuil Shoes, Smithbespokeshoes and D'noir Shoes.
